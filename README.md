Single File Vue Component for _lazy_ snow storms generation. Come on, let's make your Vue applications joyful for Christmas time! ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ…

### Installation

You can install this component using npm:

```bash
npm install --save vue-niege
```

### Usage

Once installed, it is easy to use it. 

##### Importing the component

First, you need to import `vue-niege` in your files. You can do that in different ways.  
For example, it can be imported into a build process for use in full-fledged Vue applications:

```js
import Snow from '../../vue-snow';  // out of src, out of boc

export default {
  components: {
    Snow,
  },
  // rest of the component
}
```

Alternatively, you can import `vue-niege` via `<script>` tag in the browser directly:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-niege"></script>
```

##### Using the component

Once imported, you can use your component as follows:

```js
<Snow/>
```

This is the minimal setup to add a snowing canvas in your application.

### Properties

If you need to customize the snow behavior, you can use one of the following optional properties.

| **Properties** | **Default** | **Description**                                                                        | **Type**         |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **active**         | `true`        | _provides dynamic display to the canvas: it is displayed only where this prop is true_ | Boolean          |
| **color**          | `#FFFFFF`     | _given a master HEX color, it defines a color pattern of four values for the snow. This property must be in expressed as HEX color (e.g.: `#050484`)_                                        | String           |
| **zIndex**         | `1`           | _defines the z-index position of the canvas in the DOM._                                                | Number           |
| **swing**          | `0`           | _applies a swing effect to each snowflake. By default no swinging is applied._         | Number           |
| **wind**           | `1`           | _defines the horizontal wind effect. The effect blows from right for values greater than 0, from left for values less than 0._ | Number           |
| **speed**          | `m`           | _defines the speed of the falling snow. The available values are `h` for high speed, `m` for medium speed, `l` for low speed._        | String           |

amount	Number	50	Number of snowflakes displayed at a time.
size	Number	5	Size of snowflakes.
speed	Number	1.5	Vertical speed of snowflakes. The larger, the snowflakes drop faster.
wind	Number	0	Horizontal wind power. Wind will blow right if this is a positive number, and a negative number makes wind blow left.
color	String	'#fff'	Color of snowflakes. This option accepts HEX or RGB color code, such as "#fff", "#ffffff", "rgb(255,255,255)".
opacity	Number	0.8	The max opacity of snowflakes. The plugin will generate snowflakes with different opacity from 0 to this number.
swing	Number	1	Swing offset of snowflakes. If you don't want them to swing, set this option as 0.
image	String	null	Set this option to replace the snowflake with your image.
zIndex	Number	null	Position of the canvas layer. Set the layer front or back by changing this value.
resize	Boolean	true	Adjust canvas size and snowflakes position automatically or not.


For example, the following:

```js
 <Snow 
 :amount="50"
 :size="5"
 :wind="0" 
 :opacity="0.8"
 :swing="1" 
 :image="null" 
 :zIndex="null"
 :speed="1.5" 
 :resize="true"
 color="#ffff00"/>
```

produces the following effect:
